## Whispering Dutchman Distillery - Full Stack E-Commerce Site with Stripe & Admin Dashboard

Myself and @ansonoy built this during of our final semester at SAIT in the ITSD program. For the capstone in this course, you need to build and ship a project for a client. We built this website for Whispering Dutchman Distillery, a local distillery in Cochrane. Their current website is built in Squarespace, and we wanted to give them a more modern e-commerce solution.

## About

After spending the last summer as interns at s01ve Cyber Solutions, where we familiarized ourselves with React, Next, Git, TypeScript, and how to work effectively on a devteam, we wanted to tackle our capstone project with our new skills. We decided to build this full stack application using Next, Vercel PostgreSQL, Stripe, and Prisma.

My main contributions were handling authentication with NextAuth, building the admin dashboard, and general project management / design.
